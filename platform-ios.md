# iOS

Yggdrasil is supported on iOS thanks to a native app currently in TestFlight. It can be used on both iPhones or iPads and is implemented as a VPN extension. Although it should work on most recent releases of iOS, using the latest version is recommended.

## Notes

- Functionality in the app is somewhat limited compared to Yggdrasil on other platforms - some features like crypto-key routing are not available at this time
- The app is developmental and might have some bugs or may, in some limited cases, drain battery power. Please make sure to report bugs to us via Matrix/IRC
- Each TestFlight release is only valid for 90 days. You will be notified by push notification and/or email when a new TestFlight build is available so please make sure to upgrade as soon as possible after each release

## Installation

### Using TestFlight

Start by downloading the [TestFlight app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664?mt=8) from the App Store.

Then visit the [Yggdrasil TestFlight URL](https://testflight.apple.com/join/jZNsIkRr) from your iPhone or iPad to enroll. You can then download (and upgrade) the app from within TestFlight.

Upon opening Yggdrasil for the first time, you will be prompted to add a VPN configuration. You must allow this - Yggdrasil will not work without it.
