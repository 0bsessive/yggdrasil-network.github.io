# iOS

Yggdrasil is supported on iOS thanks to a native app currently in TestFlight. 

## Notes

- Functionality in the app is somewhat limited compared to Yggdrasil on other platforms - some features like crypto-key routing are not available at this time
- The app is developmental and might have some bugs or may, in some limited cases, drain battery power. Please make sure to report bugs to us via Matrix/IRC
- Each TestFlight release is only valid for 90 days. You will be notified by push notification and/or email when a new TestFlight build is available so please make sure to upgrade as soon as possible after each release

## Installation

### Using TestFlight

Start by downloading the [TestFlight app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664?mt=8) from the App Store.

Then visit the [Yggdrasil TestFlight URL](https://testflight.apple.com/join/jZNsIkRr) from your iPhone or iPad to enroll. You can then download (and upgrade) the app from within TestFlight.
