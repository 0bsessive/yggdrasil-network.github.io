# Windows

Yggdrasil has been tested and is working on the following versions of Windows:

- Windows 7
- Windows 8.1
- Windows 10
- Windows Server 2016

It may work on other versions of Windows too, although these are untested.

## Notes

- TUN mode is not supported on Windows, and attempts to configure TUN mode will default to TAP mode automatically.
